# Identity Verification Example with Concordium

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of identity verification in a decentralized application (dApp) using the Concordium blockchain. The smart contract, written in Rust, manages user registration, identity verification, and access control, ensuring that only verified users can perform certain actions within the dApp.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Register users by storing their account addresses on the blockchain.
- **Identity Verification:** Verify registered users, allowing them to access additional functionalities within the dApp.
- **Access Control:** Ensure only verified users can perform specific actions.
